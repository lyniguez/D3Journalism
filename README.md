# D3Journalism
This was a project where we had to create an interactive D3 graph using data from American Fact Finder and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Prevalence Data from the CDC. 

I chose to graph a correlation between households receiving food stamps with children under the age of 18 and households with 3 children or 4 children. 

There was a strong 0.7+ correlation with households that had 3 and 4 children and households that also received food stamps.

The interactive D3 graph allows you to switch between the correlations of households with 3 children and 4 children.
